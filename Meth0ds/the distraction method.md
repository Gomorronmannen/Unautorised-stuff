# The "Distracted Shopper" Method üíµ
1. **Choose Your Target**: Select a busy store or market where there are plenty of people and distractions. Avoid small, quiet shops.
2. **Dress Casually**: Wear comfortable, non-descript clothing that blends in with the crowd. Avoid anything flashy or noticeable.
3. **Enter the Store**: Act naturally and browse around as if you are genuinely shopping. Don't rush in or look suspicious.
4. **Identify the Item**: Find a small, valuable item like jewelry, electronics, or high-end cosmetics. Ensure it's something easy to conceal.
5. **Wait for the Right Moment**: Look for a time when the staff is busy or distracted, such as during peak hours or when they are assisting other customers.
6. **Create a Distraction**: If possible, create a minor disturbance, like spilling something or asking for assistance with a different item. This can draw attention away from your target.
7. **Conceal the Item**: Quickly and discreetly place the item in your pocket or bag. Practice this at home to ensure smooth execution.
8. **Avoid Eye Contact**: Keep your head down and avoid making eye contact with staff or security cameras if possible.
9. **Move Naturally**: Continue browsing or acting as if you are still shopping. Don't rush out immediately.
10. **Exit the Store**: When you're ready, walk out of the store casually, as if you've finished your shopping. Act confident and natural.
11. **Avoid Running**: Running will draw attention. Walk at a steady, normal pace until you are a safe distance away.
12. **Find a Safe Spot**: Once outside, find a quiet place to check your item and ensure it's securely concealed.
13. **Disguise the Item**: If necessary, wrap the item in something to make it less noticeable, like a cloth or paper.
14. **Return Home**: Head straight home or to a safe location. Avoid stopping at other stores or attracting attention.
15. **Celebrate**: Enjoy your new acquisition, but be cautious and keep a low profile for a while.
