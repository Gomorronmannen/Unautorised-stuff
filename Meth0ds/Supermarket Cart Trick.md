# Supermarket Cart Trick üíµ

1. Go to a large supermarket with a busy self-checkout section.
2. Fill your cart with a mix of expensive and cheap items.
3. As you approach the self-checkout, be confident and non-suspicious looking.
4. Quickly scan the cheap items multiple times, making it seem like you're scanning each item.
5. Bag the expensive items discreetly, ensuring they are hidden from view.
6. Pay for the cheaper items, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
7. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive items for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
8. Repeat this process at different supermarkets rather than the same to avoid detection.
