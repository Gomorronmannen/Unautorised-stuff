# Grocery Store Switcheroo üíµ
1. Choose a busy grocery store with multiple checkout lanes.
2. Select expensive items, like meat or seafood, and place them in your cart.
3. As you approach the checkout, swap the expensive items with cheaper alternatives from your bag.
4. Ensure the barcodes are facing down or are obscured to avoid detection.
5. Pay for the cheaper items, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive items for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
7.Repeat this process at different stores to avoid detection.
