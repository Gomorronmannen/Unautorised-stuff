2. Select a few expensive items, such as designer clothes or accessories.
3. Bring these items to the dressing room and try them on.
4. While in the dressing room, switch the price tags with those from cheaper items.
5. Ensure the original tags are kept in case you need to switch back.
6. Take the items to the checkout, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
7. Pay for the items at the discounted price.
