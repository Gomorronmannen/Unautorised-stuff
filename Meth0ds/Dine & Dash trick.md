# Restaurant Dine and Dash 💵
1. Choose a busy restaurant, preferably one with a high turnover of customers.
2. Order an expensive meal, ensuring it includes multiple courses or side dishes.
3. As the meal is being prepared, keep an eye on the kitchen staff and the timing of your order.
4. When the food arrives, start eating quickly but discreetly.
5. As soon as you finish, leave the table and head straight for the exit, avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. If challenged, claim you are waiting for a friend or that you are going to the restroom.
7. Once outside, walk confidently away from the restaurant.
8. Repeat this process at different restaurants to avoid detection.
