The whole process shouldn't take more then 5-10 minutes, under 5 once you're practiced enough
I personally haven't went above 120$ CAD for an order, can only guarantee it works up to that but it's a possibility it could be way higher (wouldn't risk it)
 
What you will need :
A VPN installed on both your computer and apple device(Highly recommend NordVPN, you can find accounts for super cheap on ebay and other websites)
An Apple device that supports Apple Pay aswell as a Credit/Debit Card that supports it (I Recommend a debit card)
A computer with firefox installed (other browsers can and will eventually cause issues while making accounts)
 
Steps :
1 : Make sure no card is linked to Apple Wallet and that Uber Eats is uninstalled
2 : Use the vpn on your apple device to connect to any vpn (recommend a close one to make the download faster), Download uber eats from the app store, do not disconnect from the vpn until I tell you to
3 : Go on your computer and launch firefox in private browsing, aswell as the vpn. I've had more success with connecting to european countries to make accounts personally
4 : Go to https://onlinesim.ru and put funds on your account, 5$ will last you at least 20 accounts, buy a number that supports uber (you can see the list), they usually vary between 5 to 20 cents.
5 : Go to ubereats.com while still in private browsing and create an account with that number, use a fake non-existant email and name. Remember the password once that's done.
6 : On your phone, while still connected to the vpn and with the uber eats app you installed during step 2, sign on the account you just made. You can allow localisation of your device.
7 : Browse restaurants and the food they offer for at least 15seconds, then press the account tab on the bottom right wait a second or two until you see your profile icon change, then press Payment. Close the app and swipe it from running apps
8 : Open Apple Wallet, link your card to it (choose use a different card if it asks). Confirm your card and make sure you get the notification that says Apple Pay is activated.
9 : Open Uber Eats, DON'T TOUCH the bottom tabs for 20+ seconds, just browse restaurants and the food they offer. After a bit of browsing press the account tab wait about 2 seconds then press payments. Apple Pay should be there.
10: Order normally, once delivered ask for help and say you order was never delivered, can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 6+ hours for them to reply but you'll always get your refund. They can sometimes ask more questions just stick to saying you didn't receive anything. Do not disconnect the vpn until they approved the refund
11: Once they've approved your full refund close the app and swipe it up from the running apps, go to apple wallet and remove your card.
12: Open the Uber Eats app, do not touch anything for at least 10 second, then press the account tab, wait 2 seconds then press payment and make sure Apple Pay is gone. Sign out from the uber eats account and uninstall the app.
13: You can now remove your vpn, and repeat from step 1 if you're hungry
