# ᴱᶜˢᵀᴬᶜʸ (MDMA) Synthesis

## Ingredients

- **Safrole** (available from chemical supply stores or online)
- **Formic acid** (available from chemical supply stores)
- **Hydrogen peroxide** (30%, available from chemical supply stores)
- **Methylamine** (available from chemical supply stores)
- **Sodium hydroxide** (lye, available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)
- **Methanol** (available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)
- **Water** (distilled or purified)

## Equipment

- Glass beakers
- Glass stir rods
- Glass funnels
- Filter paper
- Safety goggles
- Gloves
- Lab coat
- Heat source (hot plate or stove)
- Thermometer
- Measuring cylinders
- Glass jars with lids
- Coffee filters

## Procedure

### Step 1: Safrole Oxidation

1. In a beaker, mix safrole with formic acid.
2. Add hydrogen peroxide dropwise while stirring continuously.
3. Heat the mixture gently to around 50°C and maintain this temperature for several hours until the reaction is complete.

### Step 2: Methylamine Addition

1. Cool the reaction mixture from Step 1 to room temperature.
2. Add methylamine to the mixture and stir vigorously.
3. Heat the mixture gently to around 40°C and maintain this temperature for several hours.

### Step 3: Base Extraction

1. Transfer the reaction mixture to a glass jar and add a small amount of water.
2. Add sodium hydroxide solution dropwise while stirring until the solution is basic (pH > 7).
3. Filter the mixture through a coffee filter to remove any solid impurities.

### Step 4: Methanol Extraction

1. Add methanol to the filtered solution and stir vigorously.
2. Allow the layers to separate. The methanol layer will contain the MDMA.
3. Carefully separate the methanol layer and transfer it to a clean beaker.

### Step 5: Final Purification

1. Evaporate the methanol using a gentle heat source until only a small amount of liquid remains.
2. Add a small amount of water to the residue and stir until the MDMA dissolves.
3. Filter the solution through a coffee filter to remove any remaining impurities.
4. Evaporate the water to obtain the final MDMA product.

## Safety Precautions

- Always wear safety goggles, gloves, and a lab coat when handling chemicals.
- Perform the reaction in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood.
- Handle hydrogen peroxide with care as it is a strong oxidizing agent and can cause burns.
