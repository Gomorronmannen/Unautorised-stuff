1. Make an account with the Credit Card info
2. Use the shipping address as the billing address but don’t panic, feds can’t come to your house as it acts as private / confidential info and Gucci are not allowed to give that info out .
3. Use Sock 5, RDP and VPN
4. Make sure you clean cookies before in settings or in your browser and after you bang an order with CCleaner
5. Contact customer support asking them how to place the order so when the order is made from your account it is then verified instantly. ( Use number 5 for more safety and I also recommend doing this for all websites
