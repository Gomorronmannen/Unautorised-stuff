# Molotov Cocktail

## Ingredients

- **High-proof alcohol** (such as vodka or everclear, at least 95% alcohol by volume)
- **Motor oil** (optional, for increased adhesion and burning time)
- **Empty glass bottle** (with a secure cap, such as a wine bottle or a glass jar)
- **Cloth wick** (cotton cloth or an old t-shirt cut into strips)

## Equipment

- Funnel
- Safety goggles
- Gloves
- Lab coat

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare the Bottle

1. Ensure the glass bottle is clean and dry.
2. Using a funnel, carefully pour the high-proof alcohol into the bottle, filling it about 3/4 full.

### Step 2: Add Motor Oil (Optional)

1. If using motor oil for increased adhesion and burning time, add a small amount (about 1/4 cup) to the bottle and swirl gently to mix with the alcohol.

### Step 3: Prepare the Wick

1. Cut a strip of cotton cloth or an old t-shirt into a wick. The wick should be long enough to reach from the top of the bottle to the bottom, with an additional few inches to light from the outside.
2. Ensure the wick is tightly rolled and secure at one end.

### Step 4: Insert the Wick

1. Insert the wick into the bottle, ensuring it reaches the bottom and is fully submerged in the alcohol (and oil, if used).
2. Secure the wick in place by twisting the cap tightly onto the bottle. Ensure the wick is taut and will not fall out when lit.

### Step 5: Light and Throw

1. When ready to use, light the exposed end of the wick.
2. Quickly and carefully throw the Molotov cocktail at the target, ensuring it breaks on impact to spread the flammable liquid.

## Safety Precautions

- Always wear safety goggles, gloves, and a lab coat when handling flammable liquids.
- Perform the assembly in a well-ventilated area away from open flames and other heat sources.
- Handle high-proof alcohol with care as it is highly flammable and can cause serious burns or injuries if mishandled.
