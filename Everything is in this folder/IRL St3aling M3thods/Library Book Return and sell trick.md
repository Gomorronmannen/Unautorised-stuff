# Library Book Return üìö

1. Visit your local library and borrow multiple books.
2. Keep the books for the maximum loan period.
3. Return only one or two books, claiming the rest are lost or damaged.
4. Pay any minimal fines for the returned books, effectively "stealing" the loan time from other patrons.
5. Remove any stickers from the library and sell the books online or locally.
6. Repeat this process with different books and authors to maximize the impact.
