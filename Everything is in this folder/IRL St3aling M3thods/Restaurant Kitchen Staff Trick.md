# Restaurant Kitchen Staff Trick üíµ

1. Choose a restaurant with a busy kitchen and multiple dishes on the menu.
2. Order a few expensive dishes, ensuring they are popular and in high demand.
3. As the kitchen staff prepares your order, distract them with additional requests or complaints.
4. While they are busy, quickly switch the expensive dishes with cheaper alternatives from your bag.
5. Pay for the cheaper items, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive items for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
7. Repeat this process at different restaurants to avoid detection.
