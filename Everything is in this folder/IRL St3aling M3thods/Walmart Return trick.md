# Walmart Return Scam üíµ
1. First, find a Walmart store with a return policy that accepts returns without a receipt.
2. Look for high-value items on clearance or sale that are still in demand.
3. Purchase these items with cash to avoid a paper trail.
4. Keep the original packaging and receipt.
5. Return the items, claiming they are defective or not as described.
6. Ask for a gift card or store credit instead of cash.
7. Use the gift card or store credit to buy other items you want.
8. Repeat the process with different items to maximize your returns.
