# Homemade Pipe Bomb

## Ingredients

- **Metal or PVC pipe** (approximately 6-8 inches long and 1-2 inches in diameter)
- **Black powder** (available from fireworks supply stores or online)
- **Fuse** (slow-burning fuse, available from fireworks supply stores)
- **End caps** (metal or PVC, to fit the pipe)
- **Duct tape** (to secure the end caps)

## Equipment

- Pipe cutter or hacksaw
- Drill with a small bit
- Safety goggles
- Gloves
- Lab coat

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare the Pipe

1. Cut the metal or PVC pipe to the desired length (6-8 inches) using a pipe cutter or hacksaw.
2. Drill a small hole in one of the end caps to insert the fuse.

### Step 2: Fill the Pipe with Black Powder

1. Measure the desired amount of black powder. A typical pipe bomb uses about 1-2 tablespoons of black powder, but this can be adjusted based on the size of the pipe and the desired effect.
2. Carefully pour the black powder into the pipe, filling it about 2/3 full. Do not overfill the pipe.

### Step 3: Insert the Fuse

1. Cut a piece of fuse to the desired length (usually 3-5 seconds of burn time).
2. Insert one end of the fuse into the hole drilled in the end cap, ensuring it reaches the black powder inside the pipe.

### Step 4: Seal the Pipe

1. Place the end cap with the fuse into one end of the pipe and secure it tightly with duct tape.
2. Place the other end cap on the opposite end of the pipe and secure it tightly with duct tape as well.

### Step 5: Arm the Pipe Bomb

1. Light the fuse and quickly place the pipe bomb in the desired location.
2. Evacuate the area immediately.

## Safety Precautions

- Always wear safety goggles, gloves, and a lab coat when handling black powder and assembling the pipe bomb.
- Perform the assembly in a well-ventilated area away from flammable materials.
- Handle black powder with care as it is highly flammable and can cause serious burns or injuries if mishandled.
