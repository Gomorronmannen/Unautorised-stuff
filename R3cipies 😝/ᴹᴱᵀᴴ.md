- **Iodine crystals** (can be purchased online or from chemical supply stores)
- **Lithium** (from lithium batteries, typically found in small electronic devices)
- **Hydrochloric acid** (concentrated, available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)
- **Sodium hydroxide** (lye, available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)
- **Toluene** (available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)
- **Methylamine** (available from chemical supply stores)
- **Water** (distilled or purified)
- **Sodium metal** (available from chemical supply stores)
- **Acetone** (available from hardware stores or chemical supply stores)

## Equipment

- Glass beakers
- Glass stir rods
- Glass funnels
- Filter paper
- Safety goggles
- Gloves
- Lab coat
- Heat source (hot plate or stove)
- Thermometer
- Measuring cylinders
- Glass jars with lids
- Coffee filters

## Procedure

### Step 1: Extract Pseudoephedrine

1. Crush the pseudoephedrine tablets into a fine powder.
2. Dissolve the powder in a small amount of distilled water in a beaker.
3. Add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to the solution and stir until the pseudoephedrine is fully dissolved.

### Step 2: Red Phosphorus and Iodine Reaction

1. In a separate beaker, mix red phosphorus and iodine crystals.
2. Heat the mixture gently until it turns into a dark, viscous liquid.
3. Add the pseudoephedrine solution from Step 1 to this mixture and stir continuously.

### Step 3: Lithium Reduction

1. Carefully cut open lithium batteries and extract the lithium metal.
2. Add small pieces of lithium metal to the reaction mixture from Step 2. This will cause a vigorous reaction, so add the lithium slowly and stir continuously.
3. Continue adding lithium until the reaction subsides and the mixture turns dark and viscous.

### Step 4: Acid Base Extraction

1. Transfer the reaction mixture to a glass jar and add a small amount of water.
2. Add concentrated hydrochloric acid dropwise while stirring until the solution is acidic (pH < 7).
3. Filter the mixture through a coffee filter to remove any solid impurities.

### Step 5: Methylamine Addition

1. In a new beaker, mix the filtered solution with methylamine.
2. Stir the mixture and heat gently until the solution turns clear.

### Step 6: Toluene Extraction

1. Add toluene to the clear solution and stir vigorously.
2. Allow the layers to separate. The toluene layer will contain the methamphetamine.
3. Carefully separate the toluene layer and transfer it to a clean beaker.

### Step 7: Sodium Hydroxide Wash

1. Add a small amount of sodium hydroxide solution to the toluene layer and stir gently.
2. Allow the layers to separate again and discard the aqueous layer.

### Step 8: Final Purification

1. Evaporate the toluene using a gentle heat source until only a small amount of liquid remains.
2. Add acetone to the residue and stir until the methamphetamine dissolves.
3. Filter the solution through a coffee filter to remove any remaining impurities.
4. Evaporate the acetone to obtain the final methamphetamine product.

## Safety Precautions

- Always wear safety goggles, gloves, and a lab coat when handling chemicals.
- Perform the reaction in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood.
- Handle lithium metal with care as it is highly reactive and can cause burns.
