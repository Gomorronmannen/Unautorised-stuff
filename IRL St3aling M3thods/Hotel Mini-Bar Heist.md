# Hotel Mini-Bar Heist üíµ

1. Book a stay at a hotel known for its well-stocked mini-bars.
2. Upon arrival, check the contents and prices of the mini-bar items.
3. Replace the items with similar-looking but cheaper alternatives from a local store.
4. Ensure you keep the original packaging and labels to make the switch seamless.
5. Enjoy your stay and leave the hotel as usual.
6. The hotel will charge you for the original items, but you will have consumed cheaper alternatives.
7. Repeat this process at different hotels to maximize your savings.
