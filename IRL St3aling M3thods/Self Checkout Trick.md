# Self-Checkout Trick üíµ

1. First, scope out the store for self-checkout lanes.
2. Start browsing for items you want.
3. Keep an eye out for security cameras and staff.
4. Pick four items: one cheap, three others. These can be any items you cannot afford or just don't want to pay for.
5. Make sure these items are small enough to fit in your bag or pockets.
6. At the self-checkout, place all four items on the scanner.
7. Quickly scan the cheap item four times, making it seem like you're scanning each of your items.
8. Bag your goods, making sure the other items are hidden from view.
9. Act natural and avoid eye contact with staff.
10. Walk out confidently.
11. Once you're outside, you can either keep the items for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
