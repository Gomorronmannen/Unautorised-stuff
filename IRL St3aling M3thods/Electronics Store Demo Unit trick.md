# Electronics Store Demo Unit üíµ

1. Visit an electronics store with a demo section for various gadgets and devices.
2. Browse through the demo units and select a high-value item, such as a smartphone or laptop.
3. Ask a sales associate to demonstrate the item, ensuring it's turned on and functioning.
4. Once the demonstration is over, quickly switch the demo unit with a similar but cheaper model from your bag.
5. Pay for the cheaper model, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive item for yourself or sell it online for quick cash.
7. Repeat this process at different electronics stores to avoid detection.
