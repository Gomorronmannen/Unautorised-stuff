# Convenience Store Snatch 🏪

1. Identify a convenience store with a busy environment and multiple exits.
2. Enter the store and select a high-value, small item like a phone charger or a pack of cigarettes.
3. As you approach the counter, quickly place the item in your pocket or bag without paying.
4. Distract the cashier by asking a question or pretending to be interested in another item.
5. Walk out of the store, ensuring you exit through a different door to avoid detection.
6. Repeat this method at different convenience stores, being mindful of the types of items you target.
