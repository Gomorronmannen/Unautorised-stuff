# Fast Food Drive-Thru Double Order üíµ

1. Go to a busy fast-food drive-thru during peak hours.
2. Order a large meal with multiple items, such as a combo meal with a burger, fries, and a drink.
3. As you approach the pickup window, place your order again, claiming it's for a friend or family member.
4. Pay for both orders, but ensure you only receive one set of items.
5. Drive away with both sets of food, enjoying the extra items for free.
6. Repeat this process at different fast-food restaurants to avoid detection.
