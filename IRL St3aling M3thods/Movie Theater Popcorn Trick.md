# Movie Theater Popcorn Trick üíµ

1. Purchase a large popcorn at a movie theater concession stand.
2. As you enter the theater, find a seat near the back where it's darker.
3. Quickly transfer the popcorn from the large bucket to a smaller container or bag.
4. Leave the large bucket in your seat or on the floor.
5. Enjoy your movie with the smaller, more manageable portion of popcorn.
6. Repeat this process at different movie theaters to avoid detection.
