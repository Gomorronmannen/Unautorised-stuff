2. Browse through the textbooks and select a few high-value ones, such as those for popular courses.
3. Find similar but cheaper textbooks in the store and bring them to the checkout with you.
4. At the checkout, quickly swap the expensive textbooks with the cheaper ones.
5. Pay for the cheaper textbooks, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive textbooks for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
7. Repeat this process at different bookstores to avoid detection.
