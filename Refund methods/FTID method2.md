FTID V1:
In this version, you don't do any changes to the label, only the box. This version is not very recommended, It's better to use V2 or V3 because they have a higher success rate for a lot of companies. Since the seller can easily find out that you sent an empty package, I never used this one.

FTID V2:
In this version, we're removing personal info and order-related info. For this version, I recommend using a prepaid label if you're able to get one. Once you have the label, remove all personal and order-related info from it. By doing this company you're Refunding / SE'ing will not be able to find your package.

FTID V3:
In this version, we will change the shipping address. On tracking it will say "Delivered", but the package will never be delivered, not even sent to the original destination.

How to perform:
If you got prepaid label, you don't have to do anything. If you're buying a label alone, put the address of the company you're refunding/SE'ing.
Then, once you have the label, manually change the shipping address to a different address which is in the same city. You can put any address, best are some another companies
one. Make sure that they will accept your package. It is very important that you change the address near the original shipping address, because every label has a routing code
which automatically ships the package to the near location. Once it arrives, the package will be shipped to the address which is noted on the label.

FTID V4:
Here we will use single side print flyers with and advertisement on it and place the label (FTIDV3 one) on the other side (without AD)
You would only use this for international orders, so it gets through customs quicker or if you needed faster shipping with say budget shipping labels.

FTID V5:
There are a lot of FTID5 versions, but here is the barcode method: Go to internet and search for barcode generator, paste your tracking number to it and then replace on label.
Now create a QR code holding a similar or unreadable tracking number. Completely unnecessary to use this unless you're doing fake return which you can check down

FTID V5.1:
Fake return is process in which you send item of a similar weight and you're sending it to the actual company. Maybe you heard of dry ice method? That's it.

FTID V6:
In this version, UPS will throw the box away and it's simple to do. First you have to get your label. Attach to parcel, beat the live fucking shit out of the parcel, send beaten up
empty parcel and courier will notice there's something wrong and throw the package away.

FTID V7:
First you have to get the label and remove address to their warehouse. Then get a transparent ink that gets removed automatically in less than 48 hours. Write with the ink

their warehouse address and send the parcel. Warehouse address will be vanished on the package and when courier would try to deliver it, he will mark it as lost in transit.


You can use this FTID V7 on a lot creative ways like:

Print customer address with the invisible ink that will get removed or print the bar code with invisible ink that will be removed in 48 hours.
