1. Refund Split: Fragmented returns on small products

Temu's system has an interesting vulnerability in orders with low cost products (<5€):

Step 1: Place an order with several small products.
Step 2: Request a refund on a single product. The refund is processed automatically and smoothly.
Step 3: Repeat the process with another item from the same order. Each refund is handled separately, which avoids blocking refunds in bulk.

- Pro Tip: This method is ideal for maintaining a steady flow of fast refunds.

 2. Exploit the 300€ rebate with Rebate100

The Rebate100 code not only eliminates the 20€ minimum requirement, but unlocks 300€ in total discounts when activated.

Rebates have a limited time before they expire.

The most profitable one is the 15€ on orders of 40€, as it maximizes the cost-benefit ratio.

- Pro Tip: Organize your purchases strategically to use up discounts before they expire.

3. Advanced Refund with InPost

For higher value products (50€ or more), the advanced refund system also has an interesting crack:

Select InPost as your return method.

Send an empty package with the assigned return code.

Temu processes an Advanced Refund automatically the same or next day, without verifying the contents of the package before refunding.

Risk Note: Although it works in most cases, Temu may perform random audits, so use at your discretion.
