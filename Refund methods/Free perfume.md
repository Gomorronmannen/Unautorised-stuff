1. Buy the perfume you want from ANY store. Doesn’t matter where, just get the bottle you’re after.
2. Now, here’s the sneaky part — transfer the liquid to another bottle (a travel-size one works). If you’re lazy (or smart), and you’ve got an empty bottle of the same perfume, just skip this step.
3. Next, put some water in the empty bottle and SMACK THE SHIT OUT OF IT. I'm talking smash it good, throw it at the wall, step on it.. Just break that glass!
4. Take pictures of the broken bottle. The more dramatic the better. Shattered glass, "perfume" leaking everywhere - really sell it.
5. Now, the best part. Reach out to support and tell them your bottle arrived broken.
6. Bonus points if you mention how it was for a fancy dinner, for a gift for someone special or that you cut yourself trying to get it out of the box. Be polite but definitely frustrated. Don’t go full rage mode, just enough to get them to feel your pain.
7. They’ll offer a refund or a replacement. ACCEPT IT. It’s a freebie, don’t overthink it.
8. And here’s the real pro tip — repeat. Reuse the same broken bottle pics with different stores and keep stacking that free perfume collection.
