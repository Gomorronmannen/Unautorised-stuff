Let’s get one thing straight: Amazon isn’t hard, but it’s not 2020 anymore. Their systems are tight, reps are trained, and basic lies won’t work. Want to succeed? You need a real method, not some TikTok FTID garbage.
Here’s what works — consistently.
✅ Method 1: Missing Item (MI)
Works best with multi-item orders or bulky packaging (boxes, not envelopes).
Claim 1 expensive item was not inside the package.
“I opened the box and only X was inside. The Y item is missing.”
Use confusion and urgency. Be polite, act shocked.
Ideal for things like AirPods, electronics, small gadgets.
❗Insider Tip: Amazon does NOT weigh their boxes for weight discrepancy checks like some claim. They rely on warehouse cameras and packing logs, which are often flawed or incomplete.
✅ Method 2: DNA (Did Not Arrive)
Best with no signature delivery and no internal driver photos.
Use a drop-off point or safe place like mailbox/porch.
“It says delivered but nothing’s here. Checked everywhere.”
Works better on your 1st–3rd claim, after that: cooldown.
Pair this with a fresh address or drop for repeat hits.
❗Amazon shows photos? Easy to bypass: “That’s not my house / that’s the lobby / I don’t live there.”
✅ Method 3: Wrong Item Received
Order high-value item, claim you received something random or cheaper.
“I ordered a [MacBook], but I received a [keyboard] instead??”
Works best on electronics or niche categories like PC parts.
Reps will either refund or send replacement — both win.
❌ Why FTID Fails on Amazon
FTID relies on returns being accepted without inspection.
Amazon logs serial numbers, opens boxes, and flags mismatches.
If they detect no return or “empty box,” your account is flagged fast.
FTID = account lock, refund denial, and maybe even debt collection.
Why risk that when real methods work safely?
❗Tips to Stay Undetected
• Use multiple Amazon accounts (Prime trials, fresh emails)
• Space out claims — don’t be greedy
• Don’t hit the same address repeatedly
• Use VPNs or fresh IPs if needed
• Keep your stories consistent and believable
