# Cafe Coffee Refill üíµ

1. Visit a cafe that offers refills on coffee drinks for a small additional cost.
2. Order a large coffee drink, such as a latte or cappuccino.
3. Once you receive your drink, find a quiet corner to sit and enjoy it.
4. After finishing your drink, refill your cup multiple times at the refill station.
5. Act naturally and avoid drawing attention to yourself.
6. Pay for the initial drink and any additional refills if asked, but try to minimize the number of refills you pay for.
7. Repeat this process at different cafes to avoid detection.
