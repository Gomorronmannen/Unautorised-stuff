# Fast Food Employee Trick üíµ

1. Visit a fast-food restaurant during a busy period.
2. Order a large meal with multiple items, such as a combo meal with a burger, fries, and a drink.
3. As you approach the pickup window, ask the employee to add extra items to your order, such as additional fries or a side salad.
4. Pay for the original order, but ensure you receive the extra items for free.
5. Repeat this process at different fast-food restaurants to avoid detection.
