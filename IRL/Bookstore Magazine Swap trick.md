# Bookstore Magazine Swap üíµ

1. Visit a bookstore with a magazine section.
2. Browse through the magazines and select a few high-value issues.
3. Find similar but cheaper magazines in the store and bring them to the checkout with you.
4. At the checkout, quickly swap the expensive magazines with the cheaper ones.
5. Pay for the cheaper magazines, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
6. Once you're outside, you can either keep the expensive magazines for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
7. Repeat this process at different bookstores to avoid detection.
