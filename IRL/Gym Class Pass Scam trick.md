# Gym Class Pass Scam 💵

1. Sign up for a gym membership that offers class passes for group fitness classes.
2. Attend the classes regularly to establish a pattern of attendance.
3. Cancel your membership, citing reasons like moving or financial difficulties.
4. Re-sign up for a new membership at the same gym under a different name or with fake identification.
5. Repeat this process to take advantage of introductory offers and free trial periods for the classes.
