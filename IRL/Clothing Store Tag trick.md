1. Visit a clothing store with a variety of high-end and mid-range items.
2. Select a few expensive items, such as designer jeans or a branded jacket.
3. Find similar but cheaper items in the store and bring them to the fitting room with you.
4. In the fitting room, switch the price tags from the cheaper items to the expensive ones.
5. Make sure to keep the original tags from the expensive items in case you need to switch back.
6. Take the items to the checkout, acting naturally and avoiding eye contact with staff.
7. Pay for the items at the discounted price.
8. Once you're outside, you can either keep the items for yourself or sell them online for quick cash.
9. Repeat this process at different stores to avoid detection.
